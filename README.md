# fantasia - a player that picks songs randomly from a specialized collection of Pokemon game OST
First up - you'll need a collection of Pokemon game OST, which I have conveniently made and uploaded to Google Drive.
Download it using this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QSzHSIAOR9RfbN-mzYwPT5KvJTYJt5Yj/view?usp=sharing

and extract 'audio' (and 'sfx', if you want to) into the same folder where the script and/or the built program resides.
Now you can run the script or the built program, input the volume (e.g. 1/4 = 25% volume) and enjoy!
