# fantasia - a player that picks songs randomly from a specialized collection of Pokemon game OST
First up - you'll need a collection of Pokemon game OST, which I have conveniently made and uploaded to Google Drive.
Download it using this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QSzHSIAOR9RfbN-mzYwPT5KvJTYJt5Yj/view?usp=sharing

and extract 'audio' (and 'sfx', if you want to) into the same folder where the script and/or the built program resides.
Now you can run the script or the built program (get it in the releases tab), input the volume (e.g. 1/4 = 25% volume) and enjoy!

# Discord Rich Presence
The fantasia_rpc.py script has Discord Rich Presence implemented. It isn't necessary to use it though, you can use the main script if you don't have Discord or don't need rich presence.
Note: Due to a bug with the module I used for the RPC script, you have to skip the first song that plays (Enter key) to make the rich presence show up.
